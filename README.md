## Requirements

Make sure that your server is configured with following PHP version and extensions:

- PHP 8.1+
- Spiral framework 3.2+

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spiral/otel-bridge
```

After package install you need to register bootloader from the package.

```php
protected const LOAD = [
    // ...
    \Spiral\OpenTelemetry\Bootloader\OpenTelemetryBootloader::class,
];
```

> Note: if you are using [`spiral-packages/discoverer`](https://github.com/spiral-packages/discoverer),
> you don't need to register bootloader by yourself.

## Configuration

```dotenv
# Telemetry driver [log, null, otel]
TELEMETRY_DRIVER=otel

# OpenTelemetry
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=php
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:4318
OTEL_PHP_TRACES_PROCESSOR=simple
```

You can run OpenTelemetry collector server and Zipkin tracing system via docker by using the example below:

```yaml
version: "3.6"

services:
  collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
    command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yml"]
    volumes:

    ports:
      - "9411:9411"
```
